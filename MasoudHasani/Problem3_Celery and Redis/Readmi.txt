configuration: celery_app2.py
celery -A celery_app2 worker --loglevel=info
task a,b : tasks.py

(ii) Make sure these tasks run in the background (asynchronously) and handle any errors gracefully.

test : test2.py




Demonstrate Task Execution and Container Lifecycle Management:
(i) Call the Celery tasks to start and stop Docker containers.
-->

(ii) Observe and confirm that the containers change state as expected before and after running the tasks.
