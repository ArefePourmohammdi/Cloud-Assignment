#### Architecture Explanation
The system is composed of five main services, all connected via a bridge network (`ctf_network`) to ensure seamless communication. Below is a detailed breakdown of each service, its role, and how they interact:

- **postgres**:
  - **Role**: Acts as the persistent database for the system, storing information about teams, challenges, and containers.
  - **Credentials**: Uses `ctf_user` as the username and `ctf_password` as the password, with the database named `ctf_db`.
  - **Port**: Exposes port `5432` for database access.
  - **Persistence**: Uses a volume (`pgdata`) to ensure data persists across container restarts.
  - **Interaction**: The `web` service (Django API) connects to `postgres` to store and retrieve data about teams, challenges, and active containers.

- **redis**:
  - **Role**: Serves as the message broker for Celery, handling task queuing for asynchronous operations like starting and stopping containers.
  - **Port**: Exposes port `6379` for communication.
  - **Interaction**: The `celery` service connects to `redis` to queue and process tasks, such as container management tasks triggered by the `web` service.

- **web**:
  - **Role**: Runs the Django-based API server using Gunicorn, providing endpoints to assign, remove, and list challenges.
  - **Port**: Exposes port `8000` for API access (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/assign/`).
  - **Dependencies**: Depends on `postgres` for database operations and `redis` for task queuing via Celery.
  - **Interaction**: Receives HTTP requests from users (via Postman), interacts with `postgres` to manage data, and sends tasks to `celery` via `redis` for container management.

- **celery**:
  - **Role**: Executes asynchronous tasks, such as starting and stopping challenge containers, using the Celery worker.
  - **Docker Socket**: Mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` to interact with the Docker daemon and manage containers.
  - **Dependencies**: Depends on `postgres` and `redis` to process tasks and store results.
  - **Interaction**: Receives tasks from the `web` service via `redis`, manages challenge containers (`challenge_todo`, `challenge_juice`), and updates `postgres` with container details.

- **challenge_todo** and **challenge_juice**:
  - **Role**: Represent the CTF challenge containers (`jetty:9.4-jre11-slim` for Todo App, `bkimminich/juice-shop` for Juice Shop).
  - **Ports**: Map host ports `14480` to container port `8080` (Todo App) and `14528` to `3000` (Juice Shop) for consistent access.
  - **Replicas**: Start with `replicas: 0`, meaning they are not running initially; the `celery` service dynamically starts them when the API assigns a challenge.
  - **Interaction**: Managed by `celery`, which starts and stops these containers based on API requests. They join the `ctf_network` for accessibility.

#### Service Connections
- All services are connected via the `ctf_network` bridge network, allowing them to communicate using their service names (e.g., `postgres`, `redis`).
- The `web` service sends HTTP responses to users and delegates container management tasks to `celery` via `redis`.
- The `celery` service interacts with the Docker daemon to start/stop challenge containers and updates the `postgres` database with container details (e.g., `container_id`, `address`).

#### Architecture Diagram
The chart below visualizes the structure and connections between services using bars to represent services and implied connections:

```

This `bar` chart:
- **Bars**: Represent each service (`postgres`, `redis`, `web`, `celery`, `challenge_todo`, `challenge_juice`) with distinct colors.
- **Connections**: Uses a secondary line dataset with dashed lines to imply interactions (e.g., `postgres` to `web`, `celery` to `challenge_todo`), avoiding clutter while indicating relationships.
- **Labels**: The x-axis labels clearly identify each service, eliminating confusion.

## üöÄ System Initialization and Operation

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Docker Compose installed
- Postman or curl

### Step-by-Step
1. Place the `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory.
2. Build and start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   docker exec ctf_web_1 python manage.py makemigrations
   docker exec ctf_web_1 python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. Fill the database with initial data:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ctf_web_1 python manage.py shell
   ```
   In the shell:
   ```python
   from challenges.models import Team, Challenge
   Team.objects.create(team_id="team1", name="Team1")
   Team.objects.create(team_id="team2", name="Team2")
   Challenge.objects.create(challenge_id="todo", name="Todo App", image="jetty:9.4-jre11-slim", port=8080)
   Challenge.objects.create(challenge_id="juice", name="Juice Shop", image="bkimminich/juice-shop", port=3000)
   exit()
   ```
5. Verify running containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
6. Use Postman to interact with the API (see below for test cases).

### API Testing via Postman
#### Assign a Container
- **Team2 - Juice Shop**:
  ```json
  POST /api/assign/
  {
    "team_id": "team2",
    "challenge_id": "juice"
  }
  ```
- **Team1 - Todo App**:
  ```json
  POST /api/assign/
  {
    "team_id": "team1",
    "challenge_id": "todo"
  }
  ```

#### Remove a Container
```json
DELETE /api/remove/
{
  "team_id": "team2",
  "challenge_id": "juice"
}
```

#### List All Containers
```
GET /api/list/
```

### Video Content (up to 5 minutes, Silent with Text Annotations)
This video is a silent demonstration with text annotations referring to this README for the architecture explanation. It shows the following steps:
- **System Startup**: Run `docker-compose up --build` and verify with `docker ps`.
- **Challenge Assignment**:
  - Assign challenges for Team1 (Todo App) and Team2 (Juice Shop) via Postman.
  - Show the resulting container creation in `docker ps`.
- **Challenge Removal**:
  - Remove the Juice Shop challenge for Team2 via Postman.
  - Confirm removal in `docker ps`.
- **Celery Logs**: Display `docker logs ctf_celery_1` to show container creation and removal logs.

## Notes
- Ensure the Docker socket `/var/run/docker.sock` is accessible.
- Configure `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ctf_api.settings` in your environment or settings file to connect to PostgreSQL with the credentials `ctf_user` and `ctf_password`.
- Adjust container ports or images as per your actual challenge setup.
